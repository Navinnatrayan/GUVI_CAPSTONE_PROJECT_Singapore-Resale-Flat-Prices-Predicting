# GUVI_CAPSTONE_PROJECT_Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Predicting
Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Predicting

objective:
   This project aims to develop and deploy a machine learning model that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The model will use historical data of resale flat transactions as the input, and output the estimated resale value of a flat. The model will be integrated into a user-friendly web application that can assist both potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions about the resale market.

Requirements:
   This project requires the following:

  #Python
  #Scikit-learn
  #streamlit
  #Pandas
  #Numpy

Workflow
   *Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to Till Date. Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning..
   *Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset, including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date. Create any additional features that may enhance prediction accuracy.
   *Model Selection and Training: Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression like linear regression, decision trees or random forests. Train the model on the historical data, using a portion of the dataset for training.
   *Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's predictive performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R2 Score.
   *Lastly, created a user-friendly web page to get the features and show the predicted resale price. This involves using a web framework, such as streamlit, to create the front-end and back-end of the web application. It also involves creating a user interface, such as using streamlit components, to design the layout and style of the web page.
